description: >
  Use this skill whenever the user needs to operate a self-hosted observability stack on Prometheus (HTTP API + PromQL), Alertmanager, Grafana, or Grafana Loki (logs) — a one-shot overview, PromQL instant/range queries, label + series metadata, scrape-target health (up/down + why) and dropped targets, recording/alerting rule health, firing/pending alerts, Alertmanager alerts + silences, Grafana dashboards/datasources/folders, bounded Loki LogQL log reads (labels, query, error-tail), five flagship analyses (firing-alert RCA, target-scrape-health, alert-noise/flap, log-error-burst RCA, log-volume/cardinality) plus an alert->log cross-signal, and guarded writes (create/expire silence, create annotation, update/delete dashboard, reload Prometheus config).
  Always use this skill for "Prometheus", "PromQL", "Alertmanager", "Grafana", "Loki", "LogQL", "logs", "which targets are down", "scrape failing", "why is this alert firing", "root cause this alert", "firing alerts", "silence this alert", "noisy alerts", "alert flapping", "recording rule", "alerting rule", "dashboard", "datasource health", "reload prometheus config", "TSDB cardinality", "error burst", "log volume", "log cardinality", "tail errors" when the context is a self-hosted metrics/logs/observability stack.
  Do NOT use when the target is something other than a Prometheus/Grafana observability stack (a hypervisor, storage appliance, backup product, container-orchestrator control plane, network device config, or OT/industrial equipment) — route those to the appropriate other AIops-tools skill. Hosted/SaaS monitoring suites (Datadog, New Relic, enterprise NMS) are out of scope.
  Governed observability operations with a built-in governance harness (audit, policy, token budget, undo, risk-tiers). Beyond the mock suite, the Prometheus/Alertmanager/Grafana surfaces have been exercised against a live Prometheus 3.x + Alertmanager + Grafana 13 stack (RCAs, governed writes, undo); the Loki surface has not (see docs/VERIFICATION.md).

  Standalone, self-governed observability operations across Prometheus (HTTP API + PromQL, default port 9090, optional bearer token), a companion Alertmanager (/api/v2, default port 9093), Grafana (HTTP API, default port 3000, required bearer token), and Grafana Loki (HTTP API, default port 3100, optional bearer or basic auth, optional multi-tenant X-Scope-OrgID). Loki is READ-ONLY: bounded LogQL reads only (labels, label values, query_range with a hard lookback + line cap and a stream-selector gate, a canned error-tail), with no write surface. Each target in the config names its own platform, so one config can span the whole stack. The governance harness (audit, policy, token/runaway budget, undo, risk-tiers) is bundled in the package — no external skill-family dependency.
  All write operations are audited to a local SQLite DB under ~/.observability-aiops/ (relocatable via OBSERVABILITY_AIOPS_HOME).
  Credentials: the Grafana service-account/API token (required) or the Prometheus bearer token (optional; self-hosted Prometheus is often unauthenticated) is stored ENCRYPTED in ~/.observability-aiops/secrets.enc (Fernet/AES-128 + scrypt-derived key) — never plaintext on disk. Run 'observability-aiops init' to onboard (it asks for the platform), or 'observability-aiops secret set <target>' to add one. The store is unlocked by a master password from OBSERVABILITY_AIOPS_MASTER_PASSWORD (non-interactive/MCP/CI) or an interactive prompt (CLI on a TTY). A legacy plaintext env var OBSERVABILITY_<TARGET_NAME_UPPER>_TOKEN is still honoured as a fallback with a deprecation warning (migrate with 'observability-aiops secret migrate'). The token is sent as an Authorization: Bearer header and held only in memory; secrets are never logged or echoed.
  PromQL is used only through read endpoints (/api/v1/query, /query_range) — there is no write query path. State-changing operations pass through the @governed_tool decorator (pre-check + budget guard + audit + risk-tier gate). The destructive write (delete_dashboard) is high-risk with dry_run + an approver and captures the full prior dashboard model BEFORE deleting; reversible writes (update_dashboard, create_silence) capture the real fetched before-state and record an inverse undo descriptor. Silences are TIME-BOXED (create_silence requires a positive duration).
  Webhooks: none — no outbound network calls beyond the configured Prometheus / Alertmanager / Grafana endpoints.
  SSL: verify_ssl defaults to true; disable for self-signed lab certs.
  Transitive dependencies: httpx (HTTP client) and the MCP SDK. No post-install scripts or background services.
  Verification status: the Prometheus/Alertmanager/Grafana surfaces have been exercised against a live Prometheus 3.x + Alertmanager + Grafana 13 stack (reads, the three metric RCAs, silence + dashboard governed writes, and undo replay); the Loki surface is mock-only so far. Prometheus, Grafana and Loki are free/open-source (docker run prom/prometheus, grafana/grafana, grafana/loki) so a live 'doctor' check is easy. docs/VERIFICATION.md records what was and was not covered.

Governed self-hosted observability operations — **39 MCP tools** across
**Prometheus** (HTTP API + PromQL), **Alertmanager** (alerts + silences),
**Grafana** (dashboards, datasources, folders), and **Grafana Loki** (bounded
LogQL log reads + log RCA, read-only), every one wrapped with the bundled
`@governed_tool` harness: a local unified audit log under
`~/.observability-aiops/`, policy engine, token/runaway budget guard, undo-token
recording, and graduated-autonomy risk tiers. One config can span the whole
stack. Bearer tokens are stored **encrypted** (`~/.observability-aiops/secrets.enc`,
Fernet + scrypt) — never plaintext on disk.

This is the **self-hosted-observability** complement to enterprise monitoring
suites: it speaks the open Prometheus/Grafana APIs an SRE actually runs.

> **Standalone**: the governance harness is bundled in the package
> (`observability_aiops.governance`) — no external skill-family dependency.
> Beyond the mock suite, the Prometheus/Alertmanager/Grafana surfaces have been
> exercised against a live Prometheus 3.x + Alertmanager + Grafana 13 stack; the Loki
> surface has not yet been exercised live (see `docs/VERIFICATION.md`).

## What This Skill Does

| Group | Platform | Tools | Count | R/W |
|-------|----------|-------|:-----:|:---:|
| **Metrics** | Prometheus | instant_query, range_query, label_values, series_metadata | 4 | read |
| **Targets & status** | Prometheus | list_targets, target_scrape_health, dropped_targets, prometheus_config_status, prometheus_tsdb_status | 5 | read |
| **Rules** | Prometheus | list_rules, rule_health | 2 | read |
| **Alerts** | Prometheus/Alertmanager | firing_alerts, pending_alerts, alertmanager_alerts, list_silences | 4 | read |
| **Grafana** | Grafana | list_dashboards, get_dashboard, list_datasources, datasource_health, list_folders | 5 | read |
| **Loki** | Loki | loki_labels, loki_label_values, loki_query, loki_tail_errors | 4 | read |
| **Overview + analyses** | all | observability_overview + firing_alert_rca, target_scrape_health_analysis, alert_noise_and_flap_analysis | 4 | read |
| **Log analyses + cross-signal** | Loki (+ Prometheus) | log_error_burst_rca, log_volume_analysis, alert_log_context | 3 | read |
| **Writes** | Alertmanager/Grafana/Prometheus | create_silence, expire_silence (med) · create_annotation (med) · update_dashboard (med) · delete_dashboard (**high**) · reload_prometheus_config (med) | 6 | write |

The three metric flagship analyses are transparent heuristics that report their
numbers: `firing_alert_rca` joins each firing alert to its rule expression and
maps it to a cause + action; `target_scrape_health_analysis` ranks down/erroring
scrape targets and classifies each `lastError`; `alert_noise_and_flap_analysis`
finds noisy/duplicate alerts and recommends a dedup/rollup. The two **log**
analyses mirror this: `log_error_burst_rca` compares per-stream error counts
against a baseline window and classifies each burst (new signature / volume spike
/ single-instance); `log_volume_analysis` ranks the highest-volume streams and
warns on high-cardinality (high-churn) labels. `alert_log_context` bridges the two
signals — it maps a firing Prometheus alert's labels to a Loki stream selector and
pulls the correlated logs. **Loki is read-only** (no safe write surface).

## Quick Install

```bash
uv tool install observability-aiops
observability-aiops init       # wizard: pick platform (prometheus/grafana) + encrypted token
observability-aiops doctor
```

## When to Use This Skill

- Get a snapshot (`overview` / `observability_overview`): firing-alert count,
  scrape targets up/down, rules erroring (Prometheus) or dashboard/datasource
  counts (Grafana)
- Run PromQL (`instant_query` / `range_query`), enumerate `label_values` or
  `series_metadata`
- Check scrape health (`target_scrape_health`, `dropped_targets`) and rule health
  (`rule_health`, `list_rules`)
- Triage alerts: `firing_alerts` / `pending_alerts`, the Alertmanager view
  (`alertmanager_alerts`, `list_silences`), then `firing_alert_rca` to root-cause
- Reduce alert noise (`alert_noise_and_flap_analysis`) → group_by / inhibition /
  longer `for`
- Grafana: `list_dashboards`, `get_dashboard`, `list_datasources`,
  `datasource_health`, `list_folders`
- Loki logs: enumerate `loki_labels` / `loki_label_values`, run a bounded
  `loki_query` (LogQL, stream selector required), `loki_tail_errors` for a
  selector; then `log_error_burst_rca` to root-cause an error burst and
  `log_volume_analysis` for volume/cardinality; `alert_log_context` to pull the
  logs behind a firing alert
- Governed writes: silence an alert (`create_silence`, time-boxed), annotate an
  event (`create_annotation`), update/delete a dashboard (dry_run + approver for
  delete), or hot-reload Prometheus (`reload_prometheus_config`)

**Do NOT use when** the target is not a Prometheus/Grafana observability stack —
route hypervisor, storage, backup, container-orchestrator, network-device-config,
or OT/industrial work to the appropriate other AIops-tools skill. Hosted/SaaS
monitoring suites (Datadog, New Relic, enterprise NMS) are out of scope.

## Common Workflows

> The CLI covers the reads and the three RCAs (`alert`, `query`, `logs`,
> `overview`); the guarded **writes** (silences, annotations, dashboards,
> config reload) are MCP tools — those steps name the tool rather than a CLI
> command.

### "Pager went off" — root-cause the firing alerts and time-box the noise

1. `observability-aiops overview` → one-shot stack picture: firing counts, target
   health, rule health — is this one alert or the whole stack?
2. `observability-aiops alert firing` → what is firing right now, grouped by
   severity
3. `observability-aiops alert rca` → each firing alert joined to its rule
   expression with a likely cause and a recommended action (advisory heuristic —
   verify it, do not act on it blind)
4. `observability-aiops query instant '<the rule expr>'` → evaluate the alert's
   own expression yourself and confirm the RCA's reading of it
5. `observability-aiops query range '<expr>' --start <rfc3339> --end <rfc3339> --step 60s`
   → see when it crossed the threshold, which usually names the change that
   caused it
6. Time-box the noise while you fix the cause: the `create_silence` MCP tool on a
   specific matcher (a positive duration is **required** — silences cannot be
   open-ended), then `observability-aiops alert silences` to confirm it landed
7. **Failure branch**: if the silence was too broad, `expire_silence` ends it
   immediately, or `observability-aiops undo apply <id>` replays the recorded
   inverse (`create_silence`'s undo is expire). If `alert rca` returns nothing
   while alerts are visibly firing, the alerts are coming from Alertmanager
   without a matching Prometheus rule — check `alertmanager_alerts` and
   `list_rules` rather than assuming the RCA is broken.

### Investigate a scrape gap ("metrics went missing")

1. `observability-aiops overview` → up/down target counts at a glance
2. `target_scrape_health` → the unhealthy targets with their raw `lastError`
3. `target_scrape_health_analysis` → down targets ranked, each `lastError`
   classified (connection refused / timeout / auth / DNS / TLS) with a concrete fix
4. `dropped_targets` → if a target is missing **entirely** rather than down, it
   was relabeled away; this is where that shows up
5. `observability-aiops query instant 'up{job="<job>"}'` → confirm the gap in the
   metric itself, not just in the target page
6. After fixing scrape config, `reload_prometheus_config` (a governed write) →
   then re-run `target_scrape_health` to confirm the target came back
7. **Failure branch**: if `reload_prometheus_config` succeeds but the target is
   still down, the config on disk was not what you thought — check
   `prometheus_config_status` for what Prometheus actually loaded. A reload with
   a broken config is rejected by Prometheus and leaves the old config running,
   so a failed reload is not an outage.

### Tame a noisy / flapping alert

1. `observability-aiops alert firing` → the volume of what is firing
2. `alert_noise_and_flap_analysis` → alertnames with many instances or exact
   duplicates, each with a `group_by` / inhibition / longer-`for` recommendation
3. `list_rules` and `rule_health` → read the offending rule's current `for`
   duration and confirm it is evaluating cleanly
4. `observability-aiops query range '<rule expr>' --start <rfc3339> --end <rfc3339> --step 60s`
   → see the flapping in the data and pick a `for` window that actually covers it
5. `create_silence` for a time-boxed quiet period while the rule change ships;
   `observability-aiops alert silences` to confirm
6. **Failure branch**: silencing is a stopgap, not a fix — if the silence expires
   and the flapping returns, the rule threshold or `for` window is still wrong.
   Use `observability-aiops undo list` to see exactly which silences this tool
   created, so no stale silence quietly hides a real outage.

### Root-cause a log error burst (Loki, read-only)

1. `alert_log_context <alertname>` → the firing alert's labels mapped to a Loki
   stream selector plus the correlated error logs (or start from a selector directly)
2. `observability-aiops logs errors '{app="api"}' --hours 2 --limit 200` → tail
   the error-level lines for that stream
3. `log_error_burst_rca <selector>` → per-stream error counts against a baseline
   window, each burst classified (new signature / volume spike / single instance)
4. `observability-aiops logs query '{app="api"} |= "timeout"' --hours 2` → confirm
   the specific signature the RCA named
5. `log_volume_analysis <selector>` → the highest-volume streams and any
   high-cardinality label driving a stream/index explosion
6. **Failure branch**: Loki here is **read-only and bounded** — queries require a
   stream selector and are capped by lookback and line count. A query rejected
   for a missing selector is the guard working, not a bug: narrow it with
   `observability-aiops logs labels` first. There is no write surface for Loki,
   so remediation happens in the emitting service, not through this tool.

### Safely change or retire a Grafana dashboard (reversible)

1. `list_dashboards` / `list_folders` → locate the dashboard and its folder
2. `get_dashboard <uid>` → confirm this is the right dashboard before touching it
3. `update_dashboard` with `dry_run=True` → preview; then for real — it fetches
   and stashes the **prior model** and records a restore undo
4. To retire one: `delete_dashboard <uid>` with `dry_run=True` first. Delete is
   `high` risk, so with no `rules.yaml` it requires
   `OBSERVABILITY_AUDIT_APPROVED_BY` (set `OBSERVABILITY_AUDIT_RATIONALE` too);
   the prior model is captured **before** the delete so the undo can recreate it
5. `create_annotation` → mark the change on the timeline so the next responder
   can correlate a metric shift with this edit
6. **Failure branch**: wrong dashboard or a bad edit — `observability-aiops undo list`
   then `observability-aiops undo apply <id>` restores the captured prior model
   (or recreates a deleted dashboard from it). If the write is refused outright,
   that is the secure-by-default approver gate, not a connectivity problem —
   check `observability-aiops doctor` only after ruling that out.

## Governance & Safety

- Every tool is audited to `~/.observability-aiops/audit.db` (relocatable via
  `OBSERVABILITY_AIOPS_HOME`).
- The high-risk op (`delete_dashboard`) can require a named approver: set
  `OBSERVABILITY_AUDIT_APPROVED_BY` and `OBSERVABILITY_AUDIT_RATIONALE`.
- **Secure by default (v0.2.0+)**: with no `~/.observability-aiops/rules.yaml`,
  high/critical operations are denied unless `OBSERVABILITY_AUDIT_APPROVED_BY`
  names an approver (set `OBSERVABILITY_AUDIT_RATIONALE` too).
  `observability-aiops init` seeds a starter rules.yaml; an operator-authored
  rules file is honoured as-is.
- Every write supports `dry_run`; the destructive one adds an approver gate.
- Silences are **time-boxed** (require a positive duration). Reversible writes
  capture the real fetched before-state and record an inverse descriptor
  (create_silence→expire, update/delete dashboard→restore/recreate).
